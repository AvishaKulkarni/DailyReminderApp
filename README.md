_So tried my first react-app trying to work on a project who befriends you and keep you up-to-date on your daily 
tasks with those annoying constant rings It have the functionality of adding task in it deleting the tasks that is done at the end of the day and check out if all the priority works are done._

_In the project directory, you can run:_
 
### `npm start`
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
